Welcome! I am a graduate student in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www-math.umd.edu/people/graduate-students.html) at the University of Maryland, College Park.  My research interests are in mathematical problems arising in quantum information science. I am interested in the following topics:

* Quantum Algorithms
* Classification of Topological Phases of Matter (TPM)
* Topological Quantum Computation

The slogan **Pure × Applied** captures my philosophy in approaching mathematics. I keep an open mind, and I am keen to learn new mathematical techniques to solve problems of interest to me.

  "*There is no branch of mathematics, however abstract, which may not someday be applied to phenomena of the real world.*" -- Nikolai Lobachevsky
