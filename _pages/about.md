Hi! I am a graduate student at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www-math.umd.edu). Prior to that, I completed my MS in Mathematics at [Kansas State University](https://www.math.ksu.edu) in 2020 and my BS in Economics & Mathematics at [Lahore University of Management Sciences](https://lums.edu.pk) in 2017.

My research interests, broadly speaking, fall under the umbrella of "Mathematics of Quantum Information." I am interested in the following topics:

* Quantum Algorithms for Scientific Computation
* Quantum Neural Network Theory
* Topological Phases of Matter (TPM)
* Topological Quantum Computation (TQC)

The slogan **Pure × Applied** reflects my philosophy in approaching mathematics. I strive to keep an open mind and I am eager to learn new mathematical techniques that can help solve problems I find compelling. In particular, I am interested in applying methods from the following areas in my research:
  
  * Algebraic Topology: Topological K-Theory; Bordism
  * Topological Quantum Fields Theories (TQFT)
  * Higher Categories
  * Noncommutative Geometry: C*-Algebras; Operator K-Theory
  
  *“There is no branch of mathematics, however abstract, which may not someday be applied to the real world.”* – Nikolai Lobachevsky
