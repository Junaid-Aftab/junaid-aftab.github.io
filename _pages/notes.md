title: Notes
description: This page contains notes I’ve written while studying various mathematical topics. The notes are organized alphabetically by subject title. Some of these notes remain works in progress, but I hope to revisit them in the future. Feel free to explore the notes. If you spot any errors or typos, I’d greatly appreciate it if you let me know by emailing me at junaid.aftab1994@gmail.com.
