**Calculator Use:** No calculators will be allowed on quizzes or exams.

**Make-up Policy:** Make-up exams will only be given for absences deemed excused in accordance with University policies. Please see the link below.

**Accommodations:** Students requiring special exam accommodations should register with the University’s Accessibility and Disability Service (ADS) to make appropriate testing arrangements with them. Please see the link below.


<ul>
  <li>
    Everyone is encouraged to both attend and participate in class. 
    Hence, 5% of your grade will be determined by your attendance in class.
    Please attend class, and ask questions. Chances are if you're confused about something, other students are also confused about the same thing.
  </li>
  <li>
    We will have several 15-minute group quizzes every week or every other week in class. Students will be divided into randomly generated breakout groups on Zoom. 
    Students in each breakout room are encouraged to discuss the problems with their classmates. 
    <strong>At the end of the quiz, each student will upload their work on GradeScope.</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    Homework will be due every few days. 
    <strong>You should be discussing homework together, but you must submit your own work.</strong> 
    The online homework uses a program from Ming Press. This needs to be purchased. You can buy an access code from the bookstore. However, it is slightly cheaper to do this directly at their website: 
    <a href="https://mingpress.com/" target="_blank">https://mingpress.com/</a>. 
    You should follow the instructions there. It will cost you approximately $30.  
    <strong>You should use your UMD email account when registering.</strong>

### Honor Code:

The UMD Code of Academic Integrity is administered by the Student Honor Council. The Code  sets standards for academic integrity.  You will be asked to write and sign the following honor pledge on each quiz  and exam unless exempted by your instructor: “I pledge on my honor that I have not given or received any unauthorized assistance on this quiz/examination.”  Note that copying solutions from other sources is plagiarism. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation.
