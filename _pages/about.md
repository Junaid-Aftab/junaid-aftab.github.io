Hi! I am a graduate student at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www-math.umd.edu). Previously, I completed my MS in Mathematics at [Kansas State University](https://www.math.ksu.edu) and my BS in Economics & Mathematics at [Lahore University of Management and Sciences](https://lums.edu.pk).

My research interests fall under the umbrella of "Mathematics of Quantum Information." I am interested in quantum algorithms for scientific computation, quantum machine learning theory, and the mathematical foundations of topological phases of matter and topological quantum computation.

<!-- 
* Quantum Algorithms for Scientific Computation
* Quantum Neural Network Theory
* Topological Phases of Matter (TPM)
* Topological Quantum Computation (TQC)
-->

The slogan **Pure × Applied** reflects my philosophy in approaching mathematics. I keep an open mind and I am eager to learn new mathematical techniques that can help solve problems I find compelling. In particular, I am interested in applying methods from algebraic topology (K-theory, bordism, TQFTs), category theory, non-commutative geometry (C*-algebras, operator K-theory), and statistical learning theory in my research.
