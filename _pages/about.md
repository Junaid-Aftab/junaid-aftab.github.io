I am a graduate student at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www-math.umd.edu). 
Previously, I completed my MS in Mathematics at [Kansas State University](https://www.math.ksu.edu) 
and my BS in Economics & Mathematics at [Lahore University of Management and Sciences](https://lums.edu.pk). 

My research interests lie in the mathematics of quantum information, with a focus on quantum algorithms for scientific computation—including linear systems of equations, differential equations, and quantum simulation—as well as quantum machine learning theory, topological phases of matter and quantum error correction.

* Quantum Neural Network Theory
* Topological Phases of Matter (TPM)
* Topological Quantum Computation (TQC)
 (K-theory, bordism, TQFTs)
 (C*-algebras, operator K-theory)

The slogan **Pure × Applied** reflects my philosophy in approaching mathematics. I keep an open mind and I am eager to learn new mathematical techniques that can help solve problems I find compelling. In particular, I am interested in applying methods from algebraic topology, non-commutative geometry, category theory and various fields of applied mathematics in my research.
