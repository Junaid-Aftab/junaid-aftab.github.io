description: Here are notes I’ve written on various mathematical topics. Many of these notes are incomplete and remain works in progress, but I hope to revisit them in the future. Please note that these are informal notes intended for personal reference. Feel free to explore the notes. If you spot any errors or typos, I’d greatly appreciate it if you let me know by emailing me at junaid.aftab1994@gmail.com.
